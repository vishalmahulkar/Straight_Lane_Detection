# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals of this project are the following:
* Detect lanes on test images and videos while driving on the highway under reasonably well lighting conditions
  * No snow on the road
  * No rain
  * Some shadows from trees and other objects are acceptable

### Reflection

### 1. The Pipeline.
My pipeline consists of two main steps: 

#### a. Identifying lines 
 This workflow further consists of several steps. Initially I tried converting the images to grayscale followed by Gaussian blurring and then Canny edge detection followed by Hough transform to get detect the lanes. This method worked well when the lighting was good - meaning no shadows or other discolouration. Also, this procedure worked well for all white lines. But in cases where there are shadows or for yellow lines, the process did not alwyas give good results. 

 Image with shadow and yellow lane			       |	Grayscale
 -------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
 <img src="images/shadow.jpg" width="350">  |	<img src="images/gray.jpg" width="350">

 To over come this, instead of grayscale, I converted the image to HSL colour scheme, which shows yellows much better even in shadows. 

 Image with shadow and yellow lane			       |	HSL
 -------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
 <img src="images/shadow.jpg" width="350">  |	<img src="images/hsl.jpg" width="350">

 This step is followed by Gaussian blurring kernel=15 to remove tiny features and then canny edge detection. The result is seen below. It is clear that the lanes are identified pretty well even with the shadow.

#### b. Averaging the lines
 Once Step a is done, it is time to average all the lines detected on the two lanes and plot it on the original image. This includes following
